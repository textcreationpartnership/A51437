            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Inſtitution being Calculated to the Perpetual Honor, and Advantage of <hi>England,</hi> for the Free Education of a Certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gentlemen's Sons, in a more Uſeful, Polite, and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Degree of Naval Knowledg and Inſtruction than hath been hitherto, (ſo far as any thing appears,) in any Time, or Place Attempted; In Order towards Fitting them for the Service of the Public, and Advantage of their Familys: It will be Suitable and Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Foundation of this Undertaking ſhou'd be Sufficiently Larg: To Anſwer as well the Capacities and Qualities of thoſe that are to be Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, as to take in the Ful Extent and Scope of that Education which is thereby intended.</p>

               <p>In its True Extenſion, is that Marine, and Naval Science, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends whatever has Relation, either to Ships, or to the Seas whereon they Move, in order to the Perfecting a Proſperous Voyage, or Navigation of what ſort ſoever. Some Particulars whereof are theſe that follow; <hi>viz.</hi> The Fabrication, Expence, and Uſes of a Ship, and of its ſeveral Parts. The Knowledg of Sea-Coaſts, Banks, Sands, and Harbors; Tides, Winds, Tornado's, Hurricanes; The Naval Direction and Government of a Ship at Sea; Naval Oeconomie, with the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Sea, Civil and Military. An Exact Knowledg of the Motions of the Sun and Moon, and of ſuch Inſtruments as are properly and commonly made uſe of in Coeleſtial Obſervations, Relating to the Sea. The Conſtruction, Management, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Machines imploy'd in Naval Services; with Sufficient Knowledg concerning the Effects reſulting from them. The Conducting and Directing Fleets, ſo far as may be taught in Scholes. With divers other Uſeful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Speculations.</p>
               <p>But Common Scholes in a more Narrow Method Teach</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Care and Skill of Conducting a Ship or Veſſel well, into, or out of a River, Road, or Harbor; (called <hi>Pilotage</hi>).</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Knowledg of the Mariner's Compaſs; Of Soundings, Lands, Points, Diſtances, Depths of Water, Shoals, Sands; the Qualities of Grounds and Streams; the Point of the Compaſs whereon the Moon makes High-water in ſeveral Places, and the like; (called <hi>Coaſting-Navigation</hi>).</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Direction of a Ship's Way from One Port, or Part of the World, to Another, ſeparated by One Sea, or More; Keeping an Account of the Ship's Movement on the Surface of the Sea according to the Methods of <hi>Plain-Sailing, Mercator</hi>'s <hi>Sailing,</hi> or <hi>Great Circle-Sailing;</hi> The being able by Coeleſtial Obſervations to Correct ſuch Errors as unavoidably will happen when thoſe Obſervations are wanting; An Exact Knowledg of the Ship's Place at all Times, and what Courſe and Diſtance ſhe muſt ſail to Arrive at an intended Port or Place. Theſe Things, with ſome Few more, are generally Aeſteem'd, and Taught for Navigation: But are indeed, ſcarce all the Virtues of one Good Officer. To wit, the Pilot, or Maſter of the Ship.</p>
               <p>Therefore that the End for which this Naval Education is Deſign'd, may not be Diſappointed, by taking in too Few Particulars, and that the Inſtitution may be Competently General, and Uſeful to the Public; The Arts, Sciences, and Languages hereafter mention'd, are Propoſed, in this Schole, to be Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and Accurately Taught, <hi>viz.</hi>
